# Plotly-Challenge
In this analysis we created a dashboard to study the diversity of the microbes inhabiting the belly buttons of a sample of subjects.
The dashboard created allows us to filter to a particular test subject in the study and view the top 10 OTUs found in the sample.
We are able to see that there are a number of OTUs that are heavily prevalent in a large majority of the individuals tested.
